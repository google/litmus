## The Challenges of LLM Testing

Testing LLM-powered applications presents unique challenges compared to traditional software testing:

- **Non-deterministic Outputs:** LLMs can produce varied outputs for identical inputs, making traditional testing methods unreliable.
- **Difficulty in Defining "Correctness":** Evaluating LLM outputs often involves subjective judgments and nuanced assessments of quality, relevance, and context.
- **Potential for Biases, Hallucinations, and Safety Issues:** LLMs can inherit biases from training data, generate factually incorrect information, or produce harmful content, requiring careful scrutiny and mitigation strategies.
